# Hello World Application

Trunk-based development with event-driven deployments via essesseff platform.

## Architecture

- **Branch Strategy**: Single `main` branch (trunk-based)
- **Auto-Deploy**: DEV only
- **Manual Deploy**: QA, STAGING, PROD (via essesseff)

## Development Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/my-feature

# 2. Make changes and commit
git commit -am "Add feature"

# 3. Push and create PR
git push origin feature/my-feature

# 4. After review, merge to main
# This triggers automatic build and deploy to DEV

# 5. Use essesseff UI for promotions:
#    - Developer declares Release Candidate
#    - QA accepts RC â†’ deploys to QA
#    - QA marks as Stable
#    - Release Engineer deploys to STAGING/PROD
```

## Local Development

```bash
# Run locally
go run main.go

# Build container
docker build -t hello-world:local .
docker run -p 8080:8080 hello-world:local
```

## Endpoints

- `/` - Main page
